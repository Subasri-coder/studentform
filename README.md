Student Registration Form

This is a simple yet functional Student Registration Form built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form allows users to input student details and dynamically manage them with Add, Edit, Delete, and Submit functionality.

Features

Add Student: Students' information is appended to the list when the form is submitted.
Edit Student: The user can edit the student's details directly from the list.
Delete Student: Each student entry includes a delete button to remove them from the list.
Submit: The form data is submitted and displayed on the screen dynamically without refreshing the page.

Technologies Used

HTML: For creating the structure of the form and student list.
CSS: For styling the form and list entries.
JavaScript: For handling the functionality, including append, edit, delete actions, and form validation.

How It Works

Adding a Student: After entering student details (name, age, course), the "Add Student" button appends the information to the list displayed below the form.
Editing a Student: Clicking on the edit button next to a student's entry enables the user to update their details in the form.
Deleting a Student: Each student entry has a delete button to remove the student from the list.
Form Validation: Ensures that all fields are filled out before submitting.
